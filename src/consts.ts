  `Hey, I’m Kelden Phuntsho Dorji — a 3rd-year Software Engineering student at CST Bhutan, majoring in Cyber Security.

I’m passionate about building things that live on the internet, breaking things that shouldn't be broken, and learning things that most people overlook. Whether it’s diving into low-level exploits, securing systems, or crafting clean code, I thrive in the space where curiosity meets logic.

This blog is where I document what I learn, what I break, what I build  and everything in between.
